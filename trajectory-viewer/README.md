# Trajectory Room

A dependency-free viewer for ORO generated-environment episodes and ATIF v1.x
trajectories. It is vendored from the ORO environment generator and bundled
into every local test run.

## How miners use it

`docker compose run test --agent-file my_agent.py` writes
`logs/environment-runs/<run-id>/trajectories.html` next to `summary.json`.
Open that file in any browser. It contains the viewer and every episode from
the run, so it can be copied off a VPS as a single file.

The viewer shows the shopper request, assistant messages, tool calls,
observations, simulator and harness events, state changes, verdict checks,
reward, and provenance, with the raw JSON one click away. Use **Open JSON** or
drag `.json` files onto the page to compare episodes from other runs.

From `oro-env-runtime` 1.0.7 the runtime hands the agent the shopper's goal
only. Trajectories recorded on runtime 1.0.6 and earlier carry a `Task rules`
block with the family's system prompt after a blank line. The viewer shows the
goal in the header and still splits the rules out into a collapsed panel, which
is omitted for newer runs. The header is not sticky: the goal and rules vary in
height, and a tall sticky header covered the first turns.

ORO artifacts preserve assistant messages emitted through the `message` tool.
They do not contain hidden model reasoning, so the viewer cannot show reasoning
that was not recorded in the source artifact.

## How the report is built

`subnet/local_report.py` concatenates the ES modules in this directory into one
classic script, inlines `styles.css`, and embeds the run's episodes as a JSON
`<script>` block. Browsers refuse `type="module"` scripts from `file://`, which
is why the modules are bundled rather than linked. Keep new code in this
directory free of top-level name collisions across files and of dynamic
`import()`.

## Brand and fonts

The stylesheet mirrors the ORO palette, radii and shadow from
`Frontend/BRAND.md`, which is the source of truth. Keep the hex values in this
file in step with it, and do not introduce colours outside that palette.

The report opens from `file://` with no network access, so the brand fonts
(Plus Jakarta Sans for headings, Google Sans Flex for body) are requested from
the system and fall back to the platform sans when they are not installed. That
is deliberate: fetching webfonts would put a network call on a page holding
sealed task data.

## Supported formats

- `oro.environment_episode.v1`
- Released ATIF versions from `ATIF-v1.0` through `ATIF-v1.7`

## Tests

```bash
node --test trajectory-viewer/tests/*.test.mjs
```

The Python suite also runs these when `node` is on `PATH`, and checks that the
generated bundle parses.
