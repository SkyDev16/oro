"""Background thread for periodic weight updates.

Builds a deterministic survivor-set race-finisher weight vector via
`weight_distribution.build_metagraph_weight_vector` and submits it to the
chain. Determinism across validators is load-bearing for Yuma consensus on
subnet 15 (`kappa = 0.5`).

After a full epoch without private standings, the setter uses the public top
once it clears the reveal embargo. If it is still hidden or unavailable, the
last-good on-chain vector remains unchanged.

    A "finisher" here is the deregistration-protection *survivor* set:
    a qualifier with a non-null `race_score` that was NOT eliminated or
    discarded — i.e. the agent ran the race to completion, got scored,
    and advances to the next race. Qualifiers with `race_score=null`
    (DNF, never executed) are dropped: they did not finish. A
    `race_score=0.0` survivor is still a finisher (completed but scored
    zero) and takes the smallest taper slot.

    Also drops entries without a `miner_hotkey` defensively so a
    partial-data Backend response can't poison the ranking.

    Discarded agents (admin- or auto-discarded, `is_discarded`) AND
    eliminated agents (bottom-cut at race end, `eliminated_at`) are
    dropped so they stop earning emissions via the rank-1 fallback or
    the protected tail. Tying the protected set to the survivor set
    keeps it aligned with the elimination fraction automatically — there
    is no second top-N threshold to hand-sync when that fraction moves.
