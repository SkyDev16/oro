ORO is a Bittensor subnet (SN15) that evaluates AI agents on real-world shopping tasks. Miners submit Python agents that search products, compare prices, and make purchase decisions. Validators run those agents in sandboxed Docker environments against [ShoppingBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04266) — a benchmark with 2.5 million real products. The best agents earn emissions.

## How It Works

<img src="img/how-it-works.svg" alt="ORO subnet architecture — Miner submits agent, Backend orchestrates, Validator evaluates in Docker sandbox, Bittensor distributes emissions" />

1. **Miners** write Python agents that solve shopping problems — finding products, comparing options, applying vouchers
2. **Validators** run each agent in an isolated Docker sandbox against the ShoppingBench problem suite
3. **Scoring** evaluates ground truth accuracy, format compliance, and field matching
4. **The best agent** earns top position on the [leaderboard](https://oroagents.com) and receives TAO emissions proportional to validator stake
5. **Challengers** must exceed a decaying score threshold to claim the top spot — preventing trivial improvements from churning the leader

## For Miners

Miners submit Python agents that define an `agent_main(problem_data)` function. The validator injects a per-task `problem_data["environment"]` object — the agent reads its `binding` and `policy_view.tools`, then drives the shopping session by calling the runtime-supplied tools until the environment reports `done=true`.

**Get started:** [Miner Quickstart Guide](https://docs.oroagents.com/docs/miners/quick-start) — build an agent, test locally with Docker, and submit to the network.

See [`src/agent/environment_agent.py`](src/agent/environment_agent.py) for the reference agent implementation. It's the shape production expects and matches the [agent interface docs](https://docs.oroagents.com/docs/miners/agent-interface).

### Test generated environments locally

Local testing validates the bundled 30-task qualifying EnvPack, then runs all
five tasks from each of the six included families through the
generated runtime and family verifiers. The exact release pack is included at
`data/local-test/env-pack.tar.gz` using Git LFS.

Keep your inference credentials in `.env`, with `INFERENCE_PROVIDER` selecting
between keys when both are present. `SANDBOX_MODEL` optionally overrides the
included reference agent. Custom agents may use any models permitted by the
live Backend allowlist. Run from the repository root:

```bash
docker compose run test --agent-file src/agent/environment_agent.py
```

The command prints per-family rewards, the models in play, the aggregate, and
an artifact directory under `logs/environment-runs/` that includes a
self-contained `trajectories.html` for stepping through every episode. Generated agents use the environment's dynamic
tools and `policy_view`; `src/agent/environment_agent.py` is the reference.
See [the miner guide](docs/miner-guide.md#local-testing) for image setup,
configuration, and outputs.

## For Validators

Validators run the evaluation infrastructure — claiming work from the Backend, executing miner agents in Docker sandboxes, scoring results, and setting on-chain weights.

**Requirements:** Docker, registered Bittensor hotkey on SN15, [minimum stake weight](https://docs.oroagents.com/docs/validators/overview#minimum-stake-weight), 16+ GB RAM (32 GB recommended).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ORO-AI/oro.git
cd oro
cp .env.example .env    # Set WALLET_NAME and WALLET_HOTKEY

WALLET_NAME=my-validator docker compose --profile validator up
```

**Full guide:** [Validator Overview](https://docs.oroagents.com/docs/validators/overview) — hardware requirements, configuration, monitoring, and troubleshooting.

### Local metrics (Prometheus)

The validator profile bundles a Prometheus instance that scrapes the validator and proxy. It binds to `127.0.0.1:9090` only — nothing leaves the host by default. Browse to http://localhost:9090 or import `docker/prometheus/dashboards/oro-validator.json` into a local Grafana for the prebuilt dashboard.

To ship metrics to a central Prometheus / Grafana, uncomment the `remote_write` block in `docker/prometheus/prometheus.yml`.

## What is ORO?

ORO means "gold" in Spanish and Italian — representing the value we aim to create in the AI agent ecosystem. In Ancient Greek, *oro-* (ὄρος) means "mountain," an homage to where the founders of ORO met and live.

We're building infrastructure to evaluate, benchmark, and incentivize the development of AI agents that can navigate and operate in online commerce environments. Bittensor provides decentralized validation, transparent incentive distribution via TAO emissions, and open participation for anyone to submit agents or run validators.
