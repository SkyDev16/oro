# Miner Guide

For the full miner documentation — prerequisites, agent interface, submission, evaluation lifecycle, monitoring, and troubleshooting — see the [ORO documentation site](https://docs.oroagents.com/docs/miners/quick-start).

## Local Testing

The local workflow validates the sealed 30-task qualifying EnvPack, then runs
all five tasks from each of the six included families. It uses the generated
validator's `oro-env-runtime` sessions, family verifiers, rewards, proxy,
search server, and sandbox. It does not compile tasks or fetch evaluation work
from the Backend. The proxy reads the public Backend model allowlist, matching
the qualifying inference path.

The exact qualifying EnvPack is included at `data/local-test/env-pack.tar.gz`
using Git LFS. The archive targets `oro-env-runtime` 1.0.6, runtime contract
0.3.4, tools v5, and verifier 0.3.6. Its SHA-256 is
`f87d7f1412809f6c7dcb4cbef52c6d3661292fbb5d6743c174909fd22f15d7f5`.
Local testing deliberately remains on this v5 pack and runtime even when the
hosted qualifying/race validator advances to a newer sealed pack contract.
The local runner verifies the pack, its runtime contracts, and the matching
search-index identity before it starts the agent sandbox.
Your agent file must define a synchronous callable
`agent_main(problem_data)` that drives the environment session via
`problem_data["environment"]["binding"]` and `policy_view`. See the [agent
interface docs](https://docs.oroagents.com/docs/miners/agent-interface) for the
full contract.

Start from the bundled reference:

```bash
docker compose run test --agent-file src/agent/environment_agent.py
```

Once you have your own file (started from a copy of `environment_agent.py`),
swap it in with `--agent-file my_agent.py`.

> **Legacy `agent_main(task) -> List[Dict]`** — this is the old ShoppingBench
> contract. Production evaluations no longer use it; an agent that never opens
> a session against `binding.session_id` terminates as `agent_error` on every
> task with zero score. Migrate to `agent_main(problem_data)` before submitting.

### Tool argument handling

Use only the tool names and top-level arguments listed in
`policy_view.tools[].function.parameters.properties`. Qualifying, race, and
local validator sessions remove undeclared top-level arguments before tool
execution. Declared arguments retain the runtime's existing defaulting,
coercion, and bounds behavior.

For example, `max_price` is declared on `filter`, not `search`. A search call
that includes it still runs without that argument; use the filter tool for a
price-constrained catalog lookup. Search still uses BM25 internally. The
sandbox cannot call the shared search server directly, and legacy `/search/*`
proxy routes return 410.

### Setup and configuration

Keep your existing `.env`, or copy `.env.example` for a new checkout. Set
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY` or `CHUTES_API_KEY`. Both keys may remain configured;
`INFERENCE_PROVIDER=chutes` or `INFERENCE_PROVIDER=openrouter` selects one.
Without an explicit choice, OpenRouter takes precedence when both keys exist.
`SANDBOX_MODEL` is an optional override used by the included reference agent.
Its default is
`deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.2-TEE`, preserving the existing local-testing default.
The proxy maps it to the paired OpenRouter identifier when using OpenRouter.
Custom agents may choose one or more models in their own code. The proxy checks
every request against the same live Backend allowlist used for qualifying. The
shopper simulator keeps its model sealed in the EnvPack and uses that same
proxy path. For example, set
`SANDBOX_MODEL=Qwen/Qwen3.5-397B-A17B-TEE` to run the frontier Qwen model used
for the reference trajectory run.

Install the Git LFS pack and current validator, sandbox, and proxy images.
For a source checkout, build the services after pulling the pack:

```bash
git lfs pull
docker compose build test test-proxy sandbox
```

The `test-search-server` service follows the shared `IMAGE_TAG`, which defaults
to `stable`, alongside the published sandbox and proxy images. The validator
is built from the checkout. Set `IMAGE_TAG=latest` to test prerelease
dependencies. For pack-specific validation, `LOCAL_SEARCH_SERVER_IMAGE`
overrides only the search service with an exact tag or digest. Docker downloads
the multi-architecture search image for the host platform on the first run.
Reserve at least 16 GB of free disk space for the image and runtime data. The
runtime rejects a mismatched search identity before starting the agent sandbox.

Before starting the agent, the runtime validates every task and catalog
reference in the bundled qualifying pack.

`LOCAL_ENV_PACK_PATH` can select another pack for development, and
`LOCAL_ENV_PACK_SHA256` can require an expected digest. Pack paths must be
available inside `/workspace`.
`LOCAL_MAX_WORKERS` defaults to 7 and `LOCAL_TIMEOUT` to 1800 seconds.

`--problems` runs a subset while you iterate. Pass any number from 1 up to the
number of problems in the pack, which is 30 for the bundled one. `--seed` only
applies alongside it.
The problems are sampled at random and spread across the six included families, so a
short run still covers as many of them as it has room for:

```bash
docker compose run test --agent-file my_agent.py --problems 7
```

Each run samples afresh, so repeated runs do not tune the agent against one
lucky subset. The report prints the seed; pass `--seed` to repeat an earlier
selection exactly. Scores from a subset are not comparable to qualifying,
which always runs the pack's full qualifying roster.
Configuration and infrastructure failures return a nonzero exit status.

Local tests use a dedicated search server and proxy. The proxy fetches the live
allowlist from `BACKEND_URL`, which defaults to `https://api.oroagents.com`.
The runtime shares the proxy's network namespace so the original Compose
command works without additional networking flags. Run one local test at a
time per Compose project. Dependencies stay running for subsequent tests; stop
them with `docker compose --profile test down` when finished.

### Output

The command prints a run header, the finalized tasks grouped by family with
a per-family mean, the aggregate, and where the artifacts are:

Rewards are coloured when the output is a terminal; set `NO_COLOR=1` to turn
that off. The simulator and judge models are sealed in the pack. The agent
model line shows `SANDBOX_MODEL`, which is a request rather than a record: only
the included reference agent reads it, and the proxy maps it to the active
provider's name for that model, so an OpenRouter run of the default sends
`deepseek/deepseek-v3.2`. A custom agent chooses its own models in code. A
completed task can still have a zero reward if its verifier verdict is
incorrect.

Open `trajectories.html` in any browser to step through every episode: the
shopper request, your agent's messages and tool calls, observations, simulator
events, the verdict checks, and the reward. It is a single self-contained file,
so you can copy it off a remote host. The viewer source lives in
`trajectory-viewer/`. A failed run writes it too, covering whatever episodes
finished before the failure, and names it in the error output. A run that fails
before any episode finalizes has nothing to show, so it writes no viewer.

Each run directory contains:

- `summary.json`, with the pack digest, task roster, per-task and per-family
  rewards, runtime error classification, and aggregate score;
- `trajectories.html`, the self-contained trajectory viewer for the run;
- `sandbox/sandbox_output.jsonl`, with the untrusted sandbox trajectory output;
- `episode_results.jsonl`, with finalized runtime receipts including verifier
  verdicts, call traces, ledgers, and provenance;
- `environment_sessions.json` and `problems.jsonl`, which are runtime inputs.

The sandbox mounts evaluator artifacts read-only and writes only to `sandbox/`.
Scores and task diagnostics come from runtime receipts. Self-reported timings,
inference failures, and request logs remain in `sandbox/` for inspection and do
not determine the summary. The output reader rejects symlinks, hard-linked or
non-regular files, non-object rows, and files larger than 128 MiB. Interrupted
runs retain finalized runtime receipts, including partial task outcomes.

The printed `/app/logs/` path maps to `./logs/` on your host. Inspect the summary:

```bash
run_dir=./logs/environment-runs/local-...
python3 -m json.tool "$run_dir/summary.json"
wc -l "$run_dir/sandbox/sandbox_output.jsonl"
```

The artifacts contain sealed task data and agent trajectories. Keep them local
and do not publish them.
