"""Minimum-spec host check for the validator.

Called once at startup so an operator running on a too-small host gets a
loud WARNING in the log before the eval loop begins. The reference shape
for the production fleet is a `c7g.2xlarge` (8 vCPU / 16 GiB RAM); the
warn thresholds sit a step below so a mild under-spec doesn't spam, but
anything meaningfully small (like the 2 vCPU / 3.8 GiB box that surfaced
this issue on 2026-07-28) trips.

Under-spec hosts silently cascade into low miner scores: search-server
thrashes when the index cannot stay resident, agents blow past the 300s
per-problem cap while inference clients sit behind CPU contention, and
every affected miner gets a near-zero score they cannot debug. Catching
it at boot is much cheaper than untangling it after the fact.

The check reads what the *process* sees (cgroup-aware CPU affinity,
`/proc/meminfo`), so a container with tight cgroup limits also trips
the warning — which is what we want.
